# IT1244 Project
Project for NUS IT1244 by Team 4- Amelia Lon Hwee Min, Kuah Si Ying, Muhammad Zikri Bin Zalizan, Tng Kai Yi

This project involves using deep learning models to classify traffic signs based on images. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a VGG16 architecture, and a ResNet architecture to recognize and categorize various traffic signs.

## How to run the project
To run the jupyter notebook, you will have to set up a python kernel and run the following command in your terminal to install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then click on 'Run All'. Running the whole notebook may take some time, which could be about an hour or so.
